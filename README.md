# Aplicatie-eBanking

The purpose of this project is to contribute to the implementation of functionalities for a
eBanking mobile application. Users will be able to create an account, they will be able to add money in
account, make transfers to other users and can exchange money, buy shares or
cryptocurrencies. To be able to help users, the application will be able to do
recommendations of shares that can be advantageously bought at that moment. In the implementation of the project 
I used the design patterns: singleton, builder, factory and strategy.
